# Pacman
Simulation of the Pacman game is done in this project using Player/Stage. There are
two attacking robots and one escaping robot. The algorithm for escape and trap is
implemented in C. Physical implementation is done using Roomba iRobot. There is
also a camera installed, which sends the positions of all the robots
for the control of their movement.
